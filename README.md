# Churn-Analaysis

Churn and attrition analysis is the process of studying and analyzing the reasons for
employees leaving a company. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and
trends that can help the company reduce employee turnover and retain its best
employees.

To perform this analysis on an employee dataset, the following steps can be followed:
1. Data collection: Gather data on the employees who have left the company,
including their job title, department, tenure, and reasons for leaving.
2. Data cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data to remove any errors, outliers, and
inconsistencies.
3. Data exploration: Use visualizations and statistical techniques to explore the data
and identify patterns and trends.
4. Feature engineering: Create new features based on the existing data to help
identify the factors that influence employee turnover.
5. Model building: Train machine learning models to predict employee churn and
attrition using the engineered features.
6. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models and identify the most
important factors that influence employee turnover.
7. Recommendations: Use the results of the analysis to make recommendations to
the company on how to reduce employee turnover and improve employee
retention.
